        "text": "The classical composer humiliated someone he found to be offensive and annoying with his music\n\nHundreds of years after he last walked the earth, prolific composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is still synonymous with classical music, his more than 600 compositions still beguile and entertain the masses around the world. In addition to be a refined artist, he was also a bit of a jokester and liked to have fun at the expense of others. This included an ingenious prank he once pulled in the form of a song on a person he could not stand.\n\nMozart was born in Austria and packed a lot into a short life. Passing away in 1791 at the age of 35, he was a veritable fountain of talent, producing jaw-dropping music with seeming ease. His rare understanding of notes, timing and instruments all contributed to his genius.",
