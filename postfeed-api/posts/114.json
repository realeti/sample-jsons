        "text": "It wasn’t always my fault\n\nLiving close to my primary school meant I could leave a few minutes before lessons and still be on time. Therefore, I was used to getting up quite late; I didn’t have to worry too much. That privilege ended when I was 13. Instead, the troubles began.\n\nMy middle school was ten minutes away from my home. Ten minutes! Can you imagine?! I had to leave the house ten minutes before lessons! Or even twelve, so that I didn’t come in at the same time as the bell rang, but a little earlier. What a horror.Human rights organizations should really look into this.Of course, I didn’t always make it on time. Sleep was too important, especially after sitting in front of the computer and watching Death Note, etc. until 2 am.",
