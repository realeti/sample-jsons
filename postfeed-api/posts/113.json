        "text": "I never understood the societal distrust of billionaires until yesterday evening.\n\nElon Musk and I went out for dinner to celebrate an increase in Tesla’s stock price. We were both overjoyed because we had an extra million dollars in our bank accounts. Yay.\n\nBut while eating a $350 steak, Elon told me that everyone is secretly jealous. “People dislike billionaires because they want to have more money,” he said. “So, they criticize rich people like us to feel better about their own financial situation.”\n\nNow, everything makes sense.The reality is that millionaires and billionaires are great for society. We inspire people to work hard and make lots of money. So, if you want to be more appreciative of Elon and me, consider using the #ILoveBillionaires hashtag on Twitter.\n\nAnyway, I’ll end this article quickly because I need to call Jeff Bezos about next week’s vacation to The Bahamas.",
