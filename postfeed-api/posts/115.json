        "text": "Stay in a ryokan, a top choice of the Japanese for quite a long time. Japan is acclaimed for its natural aquifers, and you should look at one. It is anything but an outing to Japan without the mandatory visits to Shinto holy places. Sumo wrestling is the one conventional Japanese game that is in plain view. Mid-year is celebration time in Japan.\n\nTake part in a celebration. Almost wherever in the nation will have two or three celebrations throughout the mid-year and early harvest time seasons. Go for a stroll down private roads and test the constructed food sources.",
