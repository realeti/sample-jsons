        "text": "My passion for travel started from the first time I left the US at 15. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to travel with my aunt to Italy and Greece, and later to Peru, which is where my family is from. After seeing these beautiful countries and experiencing different cultures for the first time, I knew I wanted to go back.\n\nI decided to graduate high school a year early, and I moved to Lima, Peru! At 17 years old, I was living a crazy life in a country where I didnâ€™t know the language or have any friends. But of course, I quickly made friends and had a fun time learning Spanish.\n\nI ended up spending seven months in Peru before coming home to start college. I wanted to keep improving my Spanish, which was also a great excuse to study abroad. Before I started college, I already knew I wanted to do an exchange.\n\nBy the spring of my sophomore year, I was jetting off to Pamplona, Spain for my first exchange! With my student visa and an extra 90 days as a tourist, I was able to spend eight months in Europe. Of course, I did a lot of traveling during that time. I got to visit places like Lisbon, Copenhagen, Dublin, Paris, and the list goes on.",
