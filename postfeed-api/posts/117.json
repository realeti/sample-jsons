        "text": "I’ve spent the better part of my early 20s traveling the world. It’s easy to do as long as you have a passport and are brave enough. Here are three resources I used to travel for free in my early 20s.\n\nThe first resource to travel for free is WorkAway. WorkAway is a platform where hosts can post projects that they need volunteers to help with. The host offers free accommodation and food for about 20 to 25 hours of your labor each week. You can find any type of project, from helping to set up a permaculture garden, cleaning rooms at a hotel, providing childcare, teaching English, literally anything a person could need help with.\n\nI’ve done a few Workaways myself, and had incredible experiences. My first one was in Jaffa, Israel, where I helped prepare breakfast and clean rooms. Rent is really expensive in Israel, so it was a great way to stay longer with minimal costs.",
